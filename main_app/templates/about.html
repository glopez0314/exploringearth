          We love to travel and with it we decided to make a blog that will cover most of the activities that can be done in the area. We also strive to find the best prices since not everyone has thousands of dollars as pocket change.
          We document our stay at locations around the world while maintaining a budgeting, so everyone can see how much you actually need to enjoy a trip out. There’s a lot of little gems that aren't expensive in really popular places and you don't really need a lot of money to still make memorable moments.
